# Call & Response

Use this agent to participate in a musical call and response with the computer.

## Instructions
Play anything you want in the keyboard. After you stop for 2 seconds, the agent will respond to your input.

## Settings
Similar to the **Copycat** agent, We provide 2 sliders to control the interaction.

- **Randomness**: Controls the randomness of the copycat. With a slider value of 0, the agent mimics the user precisely, but as the randomness value increases, the mimicry becomes less precise.

- **PitchShift**: This slider will control the note distance between the user's input and the copycat's response. With a slider value of 0, the agent mimics the user 1 octave lower, but as the pitchShift value increases, the copycat's response becomes higher in pitch.
