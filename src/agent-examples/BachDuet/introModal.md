# BachDuet

**BachDuet** is your baroque-style counterpoint improvisation partner.

This is a re-implementation of the [**BachDuet**](https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/projects/BachDuet.html) system  using the **Euterpe** framework.

## Instructions

BachDuet has been trained on soprano-bass duets from Bach's chordales. Try to improvise a monophonic melody in the soprano voice and BachDuet will respond with a counterpoint in the bass voice.

Some time, depending on initialisation, BachDuet might start playing in the soprano voice. In this case, if you keep insisting on playing in the soprano voice, BachDuet will soon switch to the bass voice.

For best results, try to play sync with the metronome, and try playing in the style of chorales. BachDuet is able to follow your modulations, especially if you introduce them with a cadence. 

## Controls

- **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of BachDuet's response. A value of 25 works well for the chorale style. Higher values will result in more random responses.
- **Reset**: Resets the state of the agent. Use that if the current improvisation is not going well and you feel Bachduet is stack.
