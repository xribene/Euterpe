# PianoGenie

This is a re-implementation of the **PianoGenie** system by Chris Donahue using the **Euterpe** framework.
PianoGenie allows you to play the piano using only 8 keys of your keyboard.
## Instructions
Use the first 8 keys of the first row of your laptop keyboard ('z' - '<')"
or the 8 white keys from C4-60 to C5-72 on your MIDI keyboard to play the piano.
