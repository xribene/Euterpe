# Copycat

This is a simple musical agent that mimics the user's input.

## Settings
We provide 3 sliders to control the interaction.

- **Randomness**: Controls the randomness of the copycat. With a slider value of 0, the agent mimics the user precisely, but as the randomness value increases, the mimicry becomes less precise.

- **Delay**: Controls the delay of the copycat's response. With a slider value of 0, the agent mimics the user instantly, but as the delay value increases, the mimicry becomes more delayed (up to 2 seconds).

- **PitchShift**: This slider will control the note distance between the user's input and the copycat's response. With a slider value of 0, the agent mimics the user 1 octave lower, but as the pitchShift value increases, the copycat's response becomes higher in pitch.
